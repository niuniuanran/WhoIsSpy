# Who's the spy üï∂Ô∏è

This is one of the favourite board games among my friends, but no one wants to be the driver. So I made this web application to be the driver.

## How to run

To run the dev game (which is tested among our gang of six and we had great fun)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/niuniuanran/WhoIsSpy.git
```

### Start the back end

#### Option 1 - prerequisite: [go 1.16](https://golang.org/dl/)

```
$ cd WhoIsSpy/api
$ go run .
```

#### Option 2 - prerequisite: [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
```
docker build --tag spy-api .
docker run -p 8080:8080 spy-api
```

### Start the front end

Start the front end spa:
```
$ cd WhoIsSpy/spa
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Ongoing improvements

I am working to make the game more resilient when a player leaves the room. Progress is kept in my journal [Hold my game together when people leaves room](https://niuniuanran.github.io/2021/07/20/Hold-my-game-together-when-people-leaves-room/)
