# Who's the spy 🕶️

This is one of the favourite board games among my friends, but no one wants to be the driver. So I made this web application to be the driver.

## How to run

To run the dev game (which is tested among our gang of six and we had great fun)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/niuniuanran/WhoIsSpy.git
```

Start the front end:
```
$ cd WhoIsSpy/spa
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Start the server:
```
$ cd WhoIsSpy/api
$ go run .
```
